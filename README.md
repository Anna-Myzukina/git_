The seven rules of a great Git commit message:


<h3>1.<a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#separate">Separate subject from body with a blank line </a></h3>
Limit the subject line to 50 characters
Capitalize the subject line
Do not end the subject line with a period
Use the imperative mood in the subject line
Wrap the body at 72 characters
Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
